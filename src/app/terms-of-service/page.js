                        <p>
                            Trucking Techs provides a shipping and logistics platform that allows organizations that need logistics services (“Shippers”), organizations that provide logistics services such as freight brokers, transportation providers such as drivers, carriers, or rail operators (“Transportation Providers”), and others to efficiently collaborate on shipments and related tasks. Certain parts of the Services may also allow customers and their users to track shipments in real-time from dispatch to delivery. For purposes of these Terms, Shippers, brokers, Transportation Providers, and others who are customers of Trucking Techs are referred to as “Customers,” and the suppliers, vendors, or others who are invited by Customers to use Trucking Techs are referred to as “Tenants.” Customers and Tenants, as well as any web or mobile app visitors, are referred to collectively as “Users.”

                        <p>
                            We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time. We will endeavor to bring any important changes to your attention by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; however, that will result in your inability to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

                        <p>
                            The Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. By accessing or using the Services you represent and warrant that you are not legally prohibited from accessing the Services under the laws of the country in which you access or use them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from minors under the age of 18. If you are a minor under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal information from a minor under 18 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a minor under 18 years of age may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:email address">[email address]</a>.

                        <h2>What do the Services cost?</h2>
                        <p>The fees for the Services will be as described in the ordering document between you and Trucking Techs. You agree to pay us the fees stated therein. As to any payments you make, our third-party payment processor will (and you hereby authorize it to) bill your payment card or make an ACH transfer for the applicable fee in advance on or shortly after the date you subscribe for a paid plan and each month or anniversary thereafter, until terminated by you or us. The fees are non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in these Terms.</p>
                        <p>If you move to a higher tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect immediately and we will charge you for the additional fees associated with the new paid plan on a pro-rata basis. If you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect in the next billing cycle. You acknowledge that you will not receive a refund for the then-current billing cycle if you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, or to a non-payment subscription plan.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right not to provide you with the Services until the relevant fee has been received in full and cleared funds.</p>
                        <p>We also reserve the right to change our fees or payment plans at any time. If you do not agree to such change, you must ask us to delete your account and stop using the Services within 30 days of the date the new fee or payment plan becomes effective. We will only charge you in respect of the period before termination and based on the old fee or payment plan. If you do agree to such change (which will be deemed from your continued use of the Services after the date the new fee or payment plan becomes effective), your next bill will include the new fees on a pro-rata basis.</p>

                        <h2>Licenses Granted to Trucking Techs and Other Users</h2>
                        <p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions may be viewable by other Users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other Users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>

    <p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer), reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below.</p>

    <p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant us the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.</p>

    <p>If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified Users can view (for example, if you are a Driver, sharing your personal information and location in a way that is viewable only to Shippers and/or Carriers that you authorize, in addition to Trucking Techs) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant us the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified Users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified Users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>

    <p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified Users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public User Submission”), then you grant us the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with our business. Also, you grant all other Users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>

    <p>All of the above are licenses only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected. You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide.</p>

    <p>Finally, you understand and agree that Trucking Techs, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our Users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>

                    <h2>What if I See Something on the Services that Infringes My Copyright?</h2>
    <p>In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers like Trucking Techs, we’ve adopted the policy below toward copyright infringement. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members, or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to our Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):</li>
        <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</li>
        <li>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>
        <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that we are capable of finding and verifying its existence;</li>
        <li>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;</li>
        <li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
        <li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
        <li>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:</li>
        <li>Remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>
        <li>Notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and</li>
        <li>Terminate such content provider’s access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</li>
        <li>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:</li>
        <li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;</li>
        <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
        <li>A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and</li>
        <li>Content provider’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which we are located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
   
    </ul>
    <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may, in our discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our discretion.</p>
