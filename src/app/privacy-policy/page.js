                                You must register to use the Service. To register, you may need to provide personal information that can identify or relates to you, such as your name, company address, email address, and telephone number. If you are a carrier, you may also be asked to provide DOT#, MC#, CDL#, and insurance-related information. You may also provide other optional information. You have the choice of what information to share and the services you want to engage in. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general, some information about you is required in order for you to access certain functionality of the Services, such as those mentioned above or for tracking your preferences or initiating other such actions.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Using the Service</h2>
                            <p>
                                We collect the information you provide through the Service. For example, when you interact with other users by posting reviews or other comments and by using the chat functionality to contact Trucking Techs, the Service will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any personal information.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Making Payments</h2>
                            <p>
                                When you make payments through the Service, you may need to provide financial account information, such as your credit card number or bank routing information, to our third-party service providers. We do not collect or store such information, though we may receive information about completed transactions that does not include credit card or bank account numbers.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Communicate with Us</h2>
                            <p>
                                We may collect personal information through your communications with our customer support team or through other communications with us, including through social media.
                            </p>

                            <h2>From Other Sources</h2>
                            <p>
                                We may receive information, including personal information, about carriers from third parties. For example, we may use third-party services to obtain information about an individual carrier’s shipping history and licensing and insurance status. We may combine this information with other personal information we received through the Service. If we do so, this Privacy Policy governs any of this combined information that is personal information.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Location Information from Mobile Devices</h2>
                            <p>
                                We may collect and store geolocation information from the devices using our Apps. For example, we may collect and store geolocation information when carriers are searching for shipping jobs or transporting shipments initiated through the Service, so we can suggest shipping jobs to carriers, provide shipment status updates to users, and otherwise provide and improve the provision of the Service. We may also receive geo-location information any time the Apps are running and store it anonymously to help us improve the Service and perform data analysis. We may receive geo-location data while the Trucking Techs: Driver Companion mobile app runs in the background once the user is carrying a shipment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Any user may at any time prohibit the Service from collecting location information by turning this feature off on the mobile device, but the Service likely will not permit the user to perform any shipment jobs if the Service does not have access to geolocation information. When your mobile device settings permit our collection of geolocation information, you expressly consent to our use of location-based services, and you expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action or damages arising from your use of the Service, or in any way relating to the use of the geo-location and other location-based services.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Information and Content from Your Device</h2>
                            <p>
                                The Service automatically collects information about your devices, such as a device ID, IP address and browser type, so that we can provide and customize functionality, such as push notifications. With your permission, the Service may access and collect information from your device’s contact list and photo storage.
                            </p>
